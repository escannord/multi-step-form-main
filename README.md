## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javascript



### What I learned

During this project I learned a lot, especially about CSS.
Usually we use css in the ordinary way except that there was a simpler way to write it: writing nested styles just as is the case with tags.
with this we are able to properly manage the scope of css logic.

````Css:
.parent{
  prop_1:val_1
  |
  |
  prop_n:val_n

  .children{
    prop_1:val_1;
  }
}
````

### Continued development

I hope to find other very informative challenges that will allow me to progress
